        Best Weight-Loss Diets</h1>
    <p>
        The best diet for losing weight is Weight Watchers, according to the experts who
        rated the diets below for U.S. News. HMR Diet, Biggest Loser and Jenny Craig came
        in close behind. Other diets performed as well or better in enabling fast weight
        loss, but long-term weight loss is more important for your health.

        </h2>
        <p>
            This popular points-counting diet helps dieters drop pounds and keep them off. In
            experts’ ratings, Weight Watchers bested all other ranked diets for both short-term
            and long-term weight loss. That doesn’t guarantee it will work for everyone, of
            course. Its average rating of “moderately effective” for long-term weight loss reflects
            the difficulty dieters have in staying on the wagon, even when using the best weight-loss
            diet available.

                    There’s no fixed membership period; many people who join Weight Watchers stick with
                    it even after they’ve shed unwanted pounds. You can eat whatever you want – provided
                    you stick to your daily PointsPlus target, a number based on your gender, weight,
                    height and age. You can find the points values of more than 40,000 foods on the
                    mobile app or desktop food database. Processed choices like bologna usually have
                    the highest point values (meaning they should be eaten in small amounts or less
                    often) while fresh fruits and most vegetables carry zero points, so you can eat
                    as many as you need to feel full. That’s because they’re high in fiber and are more
                    filling than, say, a candy bar. (Fruit juice, dried fruit and starchy vegetables
                    don’t count as freebies, since they’re higher in calories.) Weight Watchers also
                    pushes specially- designated Power Foods, or the best choices among similar foods.
                    If you’re mulling 10 types of canned soup, for example, you can quickly see which
                    has the least sugar and sodium, the most fiber and the healthiest types and amounts
                    of fat.

            The HMR Diet snagged a top spot in this category. Its rigorous approach “can be

            one expert said, nodding to the meal replacements and option for medical supervision.
            “This is one of the better researched diets. It’s existed for more than 30 years

                <p>
                    The HMR Diet was developed more than 30 years ago by Lawrence Stifler, a behavioral
                    psychologist and president of HMR. The HMR at Home Program – also referred to as
                    the Healthy Solutions Diet – involves two phases. Phase 1 is the Quick Start phase,
                    when the goal is to lose weight as quickly as possible. The Quick Start diet kit
                    includes all the HMR foods you need for the first three weeks, except for fruit
                    and vegetables, which you provide yourself. Automatic food shipments will then arrive
                    every two weeks. Home delivery helps ensure you never run out of food, which could
                    interrupt your weight loss. You’ll also start learning healthy lifestyle strategies.
                    You then transition to Phase 2 once you reach your goal weight, or you’re ready
                    for less structure in your diet. While the time in Phase 1 depends on the your individual
                    weight-loss goal, expected weight loss is 1 to 2 pounds per week, with an average
                    weight loss of 23 pounds over the first 12 weeks.In Phase 2, you’ll receive HMR
                    food monthly, work in other healthy food options and focus more on lifestyle changes
                    while either maintaining your Phase 1 weight loss or continuing to lose weight at
                    your own pace. Weekly telephone coaching sessions with dietitians and exercise physiologists
                    provide support and encourage accountability.

            This plan, built around healthy food and regular exercise, ranked behind only Weight
            Watchers in the overall weight-loss category. The experts agreed that calorie restriction
            and physical activity should work for dieters. They rated Biggest Loser a very effective

            As a weight-loss diet, Jenny Craig outranked nearly all of its competitors. Experts
            appreciated, among other aspects of the program, the value of the emotional support
            provided by its weekly one-on-one counseling sessions. A few experts, however, questioned
            whether dieters can expect to keep the weight off once they’re weaned from the diet’s
            prepackaged, portion-controlled foods. Though not factored into its ranking, Jenny
            Craig’s cost is relatively high.

                    consultation with a science advisory board. Many consultants are former Jenny Craig

            “very committed,” as one expert put it, because forgoing all animal products can

                    While vegetarians eliminate meat, fish and poultry, vegans take it a step further,
                    excluding all animal products – even dairy and eggs. (Vegans are often animal rights
                    activists who don’t believe in using animal products for any purpose.) So say goodbye
                    to refried beans with lard, margarine made with whey and anything with gelatin,
                    which comes from animal bones and hooves, too. Fruits, vegetables, leafy greens,
                    whole grains, nuts, seeds and legumes will be your staples.
